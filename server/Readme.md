# Comfyshop Backend

This is the backend for the comfyshop e-commerce website. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mythsoul/Comfyshop.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Comfyshop/server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure your database settings. Use `.env.example` as a reference:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

6. The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
